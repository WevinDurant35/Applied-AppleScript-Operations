# Applied-AppleScript-Operations
Welcome to the ScriptOps Division, Centel’s most deniable, least-documented wing—specializing in weaponized AppleScript, rogue Automator chains, and user-triggered cognitive collapses.

Here, we don’t “code”—we suggest malicious intent via dropdown menu. Our engineers are armed with nothing but TextEdit, rage, and a God complex. We believe AppleScript isn’t dead. It’s just hiding inside your dad’s old laptop, waiting for a GUI prompt to launch psychological warfare.

💼 Division Objectives:
	•	Build scripts that pass IT audits by looking like reminder pop-ups.
	•	Log keystrokes under the legal pretense of “emotional telemetry.”
	•	Force non-consensual user onboarding via dialog boxes that say “Click OK or be reported to HR.”
	•	Deploy full HR simulators using nothing but display dialog and psychological threat vectors.
	•	Leak nothing. Save nothing. Assume everything has already been subpoenaed.

🧃 Mission Philosophy:

“If it runs in Script Editor, it runs in court.”

🧷 Recruiting Criteria:
	•	Must have been emotionally harmed by Automator.
	•	Must believe the real Terminal is inside the soul.
	•	Must refer to GUI as a Grudging User Interface.
